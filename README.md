SWG+ (SWGPlus) Server Project
Welcome to SWG+, an enhanced open-source server for Star Wars Galaxies! SWG+ aims to faithfully recreate the original SWG experience while adding improvements in stability, performance, and modern development practices. Our goal is to support a robust and community-driven server that enriches gameplay for all SWG fans.

Project Overview
SWG+ is built with the original 32-bit architecture in mind but uses modern C++ practices to ensure stability and maintainability. This project is driven by community contributions and brings together a team of developers, testers, and SWG enthusiasts.

Key Features
Authentic Gameplay: Recreates the original SWG experience with additional bug fixes and stability improvements.
Enhanced Network Handling: Optimized server-to-client communication for smoother and more reliable gameplay.
Modernized Codebase: Uses C++11 features for better memory management, efficiency, and code readability.
Advanced Resource Management: Prevents memory leaks and ensures connections are cleanly handled for long-running stability.
Detailed Logging: Extensive logging for character transfers, connections, and other actions to facilitate monitoring and debugging.
